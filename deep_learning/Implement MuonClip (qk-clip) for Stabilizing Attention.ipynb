    "Implement MuonClip (qk-clip) for Stabilizing Attention\n",

    "\n",
    "Write a function that applies the MuonClip qk-clip step to attention projection weights W_q and W_k. Given input features x, a threshold t, and a mixing parameter alpha, your function must: (1) compute the maximum pre-clip QK score (scaled by 1/sqrt(d_head)); (2) if this max score exceeds t, rescale W_q and W_k by eta^alpha and eta^(1-alpha), where eta = t / max_score; (3) return the (possibly) rescaled weights, a boolean indicating whether clipping occurred, and the post-clip max score. Round all returned floating values to 4 decimals for reproducibility in tests.\n",

    "Reasoning:\n",
    "Pre-clip max score is 4/√2 ≈ 2.8284 (> 1.0). With η = 1/2.8284 and α = 0.5, both W_q and W_k are scaled by √η, bringing the max score to t.\n",
